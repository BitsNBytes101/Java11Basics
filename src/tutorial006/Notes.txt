What are Arithmetic operators:
    Arithmetic operators are symbols(+,-,*,/,%,) that we use to perform basic math
    operations like addition, multiplication, division and modulus operation.
Why we need them.
    When we build real life programs like a program that can automatically
    perform testing of a website for us or a game, many times we need
    to perform these basic math operations. we use these operators to perform
    these basic calculation.
How can we use Arithmetic operators:
    We can use them to perform operations directly on numbers.
    Like System.out.println(10+10) // 20, or we
    can use them with tutorial003 we can print the results we can store
    them in tutorial003 etc.

Modulus operator:
    It gives us remainder for example if we divide a number and number is
    not completely divisible we will get the remainder part
    lets do an example 5/2 answer is 1 and remainder is 1
    you can also think about it there are 5 slices of pizza that you want
    to divide between two friends completely how many pieces they will get
    and how much will be left
