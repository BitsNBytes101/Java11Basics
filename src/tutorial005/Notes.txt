What are Java Naming conventions?
    Java Naming conventions are some set of rules that are recommended by the guys who
    made java.
Why do we need Java Naming conventions?
    If we follow all the rules and all the Java conventions our code will look organized,
    and it will be easy to read. We will also face fewer errors. Remember when you work as a
    Java developer in most cases 70% of the time you are reading code written by others.
    only 30 % of the time we write new code.
Some java Conventions:
    1) Name of the package should be in lowercase
    2) First letters of all the words in a class name must be the upper case for example
        I) FileDownloader
        II) VariablesDemo
        III) ArithmeticOperators
   3) First letters of all the words of tutorial003 must be the upper case except the first word.
        I) firstName
        II) lastName
        III) myAge
What are Comments?
    Comments are small notes that we can write with our code they are ignored
    by Java.
Why we need them?
    Sometimes when we are working on something complex we can use comments
    to leave explanations in some plan English so that later on if someone
    reads our code they can understand it easily.
How can we write comments?
    There are two types of comments single line and multi-line
    1) single Lines comments:
        single line comments start with two forward slashes // they are
        used if we need to write only one line of comment or note.
    2) Multiple Line comments:
        Multiline comments /**/ start with a forward slash start and start again
        with a forward slash. They are used when we have to write multiple lines of
        explanation.
