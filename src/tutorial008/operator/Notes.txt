What are tutorial008 operators?
    ShortHand Operators are some symbols that we can use to perform some
    calculations quickly just like we use shortcuts on out computers to do the same
    thing quickly.
Why we should use Shorthand Operators?
    If we use tutorial008 operators we can save a lot of time and storage by
    writing less code.
How to use ?
    let's say we have a variable that has some value in it for example
    int myNumber=10, and we want to add 10 more to it one way of doing it is
    myNumber=myNumber+10; pick previous value of x add 10 to it and store it back in 10
    but if we use a tutorial008 operator instead it will look something like this
    myNumber+=10; as you can see we don't need to type the variable name twice if
    we use shortHand operator.
