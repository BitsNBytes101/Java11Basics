    if-else-if conditions are used to perform multiple actions based on multiple
    conditions.

    whenever we have to perform multiple different operations based on different conditions we use
    if-else-if conditions for example based on the day number print day name here day variable can
    have 7 different values, and we have to generate 7 different outputs this can be easily done with
    if-else-if conditions.
