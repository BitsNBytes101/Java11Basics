What are Variable?
    Variables are containers or boxes in the memory that can hold different types of data
     like numbers(10,120.5,1000), text("jack","new york","Bus"), characters('a','F',@,$,%)
      and boolean(true,false) for us.
Why we need Variables:
     If we want a computer to do something for us for example play a video for us, open a browser,
     draw something on the computer screen or build a software like  Google Chrome, Whatsapp,
     or build a website like facebook or amazon or build games like pubg we need to store data
     and instructions in a very organised way inside a computer than only computer can do all above
     tasks for us. We use variables to store this data.
How to create the variables(Java Syntax):
    1) We need to tell the computer what type of box/container/variable we need this type depends on
    what type of data we are going to store inside that box like numbers or text etc.
    2) We need to give a name to the box so that whenever we need that data again we can tell the
    name of the box to the computer, and it can bring the data from memory.
Types of variables.
    There are 8 basic types of variables.
Boxes to store whole numbers(23,45,67,894,1000):
    1)byte  ( smallest box to hold whole numbers can only put numbers from -128 to 127)
    2)short (double the capacity of byte in terms of number of bits)
    3)int (most famous for whole numbers can store up to billions)
    4)long ( largest box to store whole numbers)
Boxes to store decimal numbers(12.3, 45.5, 1.5,0.2,11110.45)
    1)float( smallest box to hold decimal numbers)
    2)double (double the capacity of float)
Boxes to store characters('A','3','@','$')
    1)char
Boxes to store boolean(true,false) in computers true means yes and false means no.
    1) boolean
We also have some advance data types called non-primitive data types. These data types can hold
complex information like complete sentences or paragraphs mixture of numbers letters and symbols.
but Here we will only discuss one called String.
Non-primitive:
Boxes to store complex data.("Street #123","+1571-2333-3333")
    1)String ( can hold all characters present on keyboard sequence of characters )
