What are relational operators?
    Relational operators are used to compare two values
    from same data type for example if one number is greater than
    or not if two boolean values are same or not.
Below are some Relational operators:
    x==y checks if x and y are same if yes returns true otherwise false
    x!=y called not equal to returns true if x and y are not equal otherwise false
    x>y true if x is greater than y otherwise false
    x<y true if x is less than y otherwise true
    x>=y checks two conditions x>y or x==y anyone is true result is true both
         are false result is false

    x<=y opposite of >= checks two conditions x<y or x==y any one is true result is true
Why we need Relational operators?
    Relational operators are used in decision-making using if else conditions,
    without them, we can't compare data and can't make our programs to take decisions.
    for example if hard-disk is full show an error and not allow more data
    if internet is not available display a message check internet connections
    if date is equal to DOB show happy birthday
how to use relational operators?
place the data and relational operator nineteen, and it will return a boolean true or
false
Note: output of applying relational operator is always a boolean true or false.
