What are if conditions in java:
    if conditions are used to implement decision-making in code just like we
    humans take a lot of decisions in our life based on many conditions
    we use these if conditions in code so that the computer programs can
    also take decision like us.
Why we should learn if conditions.
    With the help of if conditions the programs that we write
    can take decisions just like us, and we can write intelligent programs
    for example program automatically checks what time it is a sends a email
    or checks a website and if logo is present says logo is present
How to use if else conditions:
    for if or if else conditions to work we need to understand what are
    conditions and how they work.
