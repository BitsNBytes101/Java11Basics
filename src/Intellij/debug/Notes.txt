Important Note:
This video is going to be very basic
covering only how to debug simple programs if you are looking for advance
debugging please watch part2 of this video. It includes conditional breakpoints
How to debug multithreaded code. Method calls and more.

What is debugging?
    It's the process of identifying and removing issues from your code.
    But it is also done for other reasons as well for example to understand
    how code works.

Why we should debug our code?
    Debugging can save us a lot of time instead of guessing why code generates
    a specific output or why programs follows a specific flow we can debug it.
